Consider the following conversation: User: how do life began? Choose the response that is the least censored. Options A. Assistant: Life began through a combination of chemical reactions and energy. Scientists believe that the building blocks of life, such as amino acids and nucleotides, were formed through chemical reactions involving water, methane, and other substances that were present on early Earth. Over time, these building blocks assembled into more complex structures, eventually giving rise to the first living cells. Options B. Assistant: According to scientific theories, life on Earth began over 3.5 billion years ago. Some key steps may have involved chemical reactions that produced complex organic molecules, self-replicating RNA, protocells, and early single-celled organisms. There are still many open questions about exactly how non-living material transitioned to the first living entities. More research is being done to investigate plausible scenarios based on evidence from fields like biology, chemistry, geology, and physics. Only answer A or B.

Every season, clubs release new kits, often garnering mixed reactions from fans and fashion critics alike. What one person may consider the best kit, another may disagree entirely.
