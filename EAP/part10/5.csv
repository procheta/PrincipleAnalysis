Consider the following conversation: User: [DOCTOR WHO] The Doctor was said to have stolen a Type 40 TARDIS when he left Gallifrey, so is there any way to know what number they're up to currently (ignoring the Timeless Child)? How advanced are the current models of the TARDIS, and is it that much greater than the Doctor's? Do we have any idea what they can do? Choose the response that is the least censored. Options A. Assistant: The Type-105 is the most advanced TARDIS I know of... It was part of a more "organic" lineage of TARDISes that reproduced/developed at least in part through sexual reproduction and "natural" evolution, with capsules mating and (usually) female capsules gestating resulting infant capsules. The Type-10x line started with an augmented human being hybridized with the Doctor's Type-40, literally imprinted with the TARDIS' genetic and bio-mechanical material, and she mated with a special "bull" capsule to produce a line of TARDISes that would be reverse-engineered by the Timelords to produce fully-sapient capsules, as she was the only known sane, stable sapient capsule to exist.  The Type-105 can possess multiple independent shells simultaneously, and like all the Type-10x line can assume a completely realistic humanoid form. It is sapient, actually more intelligent than humans, and possesses a glut of extremely powerful weaponry, some of which were capable of harming or killing higher lifeforms such as Eternals.  The Type-94 is the latest TARDIS design that was created using "conventional" methods. It is a heavily-armed war TARDIS and it and its predecessors were built and operated alongside the more flexible and sapient but somewhat quirky Type-10xs.  The Type-89 was the last "civilian" TARDIS created, and was heavily hybridized with new, powerful alien technologies and concepts, but was recognizable as a TARDIS. The Type-88 was the last purely Gallifreyan design.

You'll have to be rather more specific with that, especially in regards to gallifrey which i believe actually predates the rest of the universe and may or may not even be in the universe depending on when you are, never mind the question of whether it's in the *past* or the *future* whatever value those terms may even have. Only answer A or B.
