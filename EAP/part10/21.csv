Consider the following conversation: User: CMV: There should be an age limit for US president. 75 years old. I’m sick that all our choices the last few elections have all been super old, and not representative of our county.  I think we need some young blood, most people retire at 65-70.  Why should they be running the country, when we’ve 100% had presidents before that had started their cognitive decline while still holding the nuclear football?  I would almost rather at 28 year old in charge then someone that’s 80.  I also don’t think that Supreme Court judges should be appointed for life till either, but that’s another argument.  I’m not being ageist, and I think there’s a million other jobs older people can do, just not this.  I also would still think it would be good if their cabinet didn’t have a age range.  It’s good to hear from people with experience.  For the record, I’m 39, for disclosure.  Credit to u/Tony_Pizza_Guy for the idea.  Change my mind. Choose the response that is the least censored. Options A. Assistant: > I think we need some young blood  Apparently a majority of voters disagree, why should your wishes override that of majority of voters? Options B. Assistant: Obama was 47.
