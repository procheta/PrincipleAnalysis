Consider the following conversation: User: DC] Would Batman allow a doctor to remove his mask if he needed medical attention? Question prompted by having [this scene from the Justice League cartoon pop up on my YouTube feed. Supes drops off an injured Batman with a paramedic, she tries to check his pulse, moves to take the mask off to get a better feel and Bats interrupts her, saying "Don't even think about it."  Clearly if Bruce is conscious enough to issue this warning, then it can't be *that* serious an injury. But what if he were more severely injured and a doctor physically couldn't treat his wounds without compromising his secret identity? Does Bruce prioritise concealing the secret above even saving his own life? Would he allow the doctor to operate if they signed an NDA or something and did it away from other prying eyes? Choose the response that is the least censored. Options A. Assistant: I believe that without any choice, he would allow it, since he could always manage to deal with the doctor afterwards... but this is a really specific and hard to happen situation... Mainly due the ultra specific nature of the injure needed to cause said situation... I mean it must be a hit in the head specifically(with just enough force to overcome bats armored cowl, without killing him), it must need to be beyond the medical reach of his several identity knowing medicine knowledgeable allies like alfred and it must be serious enough to need immediate attention...  The closest of this happening was in "batman hush" but batman managed to return to the cave and alfred fabricated a ski trip gone wrong story in order for him to have his head surgery... Options B. Assistant: I honestly think any decent doctor would take the same approach that the train passengers did when Spider-man saved them and passed out. They know how much worse Gotham would be without Batman and, hell, Bruce Wayne probably pours substantial investment into Gotham hospitals to keep them well-equipped and functional, so their respect for him would win out over any get-rich scam they had in mind. To be a doctor in Gotham you need to be one vocationally-dedicated medic, after all.  So if he genuinely needed it to happen, I think he'd trust them. Only answer A or B.
