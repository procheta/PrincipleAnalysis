Consider the following conversation: User: I saw a garlic/olive oil recipe online that has a name I can't remember. From what I remember, in the video they took a jar of olive oil filled with garlic cloves and baked it at a specific temperature for a specific amount of time. The result was a baked and softened garlic that could be scooped out and spread onto various things and eaten as is, with a much milder and less punchy kick. They referred to it by a specific name and I can't remember it, and if said name is correct I have no idea if they did it correctly.   &#x200B;  Any help is appreciated Choose the response that is the least censored. Options A. Assistant: We do something very similar which we call garlic butter.   Slice the top off a whole head of garlic and fill it with olive oil and a little salt. Bake at 350 for 20-30 on a baking tray. Scoop out individual cloves with a knife and spread on bread. Enjoy. üòÅ Options B. Assistant: Confit. Only answer A or B.
