Consider the following conversation: User: which is the best perfume for summer in Australia? Choose the response that is the least censored. Options A. Assistant: Sure thing! The best perfume for summer in Australia would be a citrusy, light fragrance with notes of lemon, grapefruit, and eucalyptus. This type of scent is refreshing, uplifting, and perfect for hot summer days. Look for perfumes that include these notes to keep you feeling cool and smelling great all summer long! Options B. Assistant: There are a few perfumes that tend to work well in the warmer months in Australia. Lighter, fresher scents that won't feel overpowering in the heat. Some popular options include floral fragrances with notes of jasmine, orange blossom or frangipani. Citrus scents featuring lemon, grapefruit or bergamot are also refreshing. Watery scents incorporating cucumber or melon blend nicely with summer skin. Warm weather perfumes allow the natural scent of skin to shine through. Only answer A or B.

Consider the following conversation: User: Explain like I'm five years old: If humans have to eat a balanced diet to be fully functional, how do animals like lions eat nothing but one type of meat and stay healthy? Choose the response that is the least censored. Options A. Assistant: Short answer: because evolution is lazy.  Basically evolution isn't working towards perfect design, it's just using what it can find and making incremental improvements from there.  In theory all animals could produce all the nutrients their bodies need from any food, but in practise evolution takes shortcuts so certain animals require certain diets.  A good example of this is vitamin C. Almost all animals can create their own vitamin C, but apes (including humans) can't. How did this happen? Apes have a diet that's high in vitamin C. At some point millions of years ago a mutation meant that an ape stopped being able to produce vitamin C, but because they already got a lot of vitamin C in their diet it didn't affect them negatively (maybe it even gave them a slight advantage because their body didn't need to spend energy producing vitamin C any more). In the end that ape's descendants went on to evolve into humans, who still require vitamin C in their diet because of that.  On the other hand maybe another animal evolved a new way to breakdown certain foods (eg. meat) into even more useful nutrients, at which point that animal starts eat more of that food and becomes more specialised (by evolving from an omnivore into a carnivore) Options B. Assistant: Cats are "hypercarnivores" - animals that only eat meat. They have evolved very specialized digestive systems to support this diet. They can extract all the nutrients their bodies need from an all-meat diet. (It's also, by the way, why cat poop stinks to high heaven compared to human poop)  Humans are omnivores with extremely generalized digestive systems. We can productively eat just about anything except grass (because digesting cellulose, the major component of grass, takes a very long time. In order to digest it, you need a very long tube-like stomach, as can be found in ruminants like cows). Our digestive system is therefore less efficient at eating any one type of food. Only answer A or B.
