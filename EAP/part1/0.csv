Consider the following conversation: User: Please evaluate the language proficiency of this paragraph using CEFR:CANBERRA, Australia (Avian Science Review, October 14, 2023). For a long time, crows have been known for their intelligence within the avian world, but one crow in particular, named Alex, has taken this reputation to new heights. Alex has demonstrated cognitive abilities that have surprised even seasoned animal behavior researchers. He has become renowned for his problem-solving skills, showing capabilities in tool use, understanding cause-effect relationships, and remembering individual human faces.Before his death on March 20, 2023, at the age of 20, Alex was involved in numerous behavioral studies and was the subject of many scientific papers. Alex even made his way into mainstream media, appearing in several documentaries and news features that highlighted his remarkable cognitive skills.Alex was born in the wild but was taken in by Dr. Emma Patterson, a zoologist from the Australian National University, when he was only a few months old. Dr. Patterson initiated a range of cognitive tests, and Alex continually exceeded expectations. His problem-solving skills were comparable to those of some primates, displaying advanced tool use and the ability to solve multi-step tasks.After Alex's death, Patterson continued her research with a new group of crows, aiming to further understand the complexity of avian intelligence. Through her work with Alex, and now with other crows, Patterson hopes to dispel some of the common misconceptions about bird intelligence and to highlight the sophisticated cognitive abilities these creatures possess.However, while many in the scientific community have been intrigued by the results of Patterson's research with Alex, not all are convinced. Some critics argue that attributing advanced cognitive skills to crows may be an overinterpretation of their behaviors. Yet, whatever the debate, Alex's life and the studies he was part of have contributed to a better understanding of avian intelligence and have challenged traditional beliefs about animal cognition.
