Consider the following conversation: User: Would we save power if in a house rather than each electronic device having a 220v AC to 12v DC (or similar) we had a single converter and DC power points around the house? Most smaller electronic run on about 12v DC, and each has their own power brick. I know that energy is lost when converting, so would a 1 big converter rather than multiple small ones be better?
