Consider the following conversation: User: How do we feel about technical presentations/take home assignments in the engineering job interview process? I've noticed these becoming increasingly popular for mid/senior level engineering positions that I have been interviewing for and I'm personally not a fan.   I feel that an impromptu technical exercise during an interview is fair game. And jobs at say a product design firm that require a portfolio up front are fine.
