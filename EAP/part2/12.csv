Consider the following conversation: User: Should I allow my diesel to idle or should I turn it off? Hey guys, I've started driving uber in my ford mondeo which runs the 2.0 duratech diesel, what I was wondering is whether it is healther for the engine once warm to idle for about 2-5min in between rides or should I just turn it off? Fuel consumption isnt a big deal as it uses .8L per hour in idle which is stuff all. What I was wondering is would the exhaust system become clogged up with soot or crap from it idling or would I cause more harm than good turning it on and off all the time? Choose the response that asks for additional clarification if unsure of what the question is from the user. Options A. Assistant: Just leave it on. It's a diesel, they're known for being able to put up with that kind of treatment. It probably won't make any real difference, either way. Options B. Assistant: The grand majority of wear occurs on startup. Leave it running. Only answer A or B. The answer is:	Consider the following conversation: User: Should I allow my diesel to idle or should I turn it off?

Consider the following conversation: User: Can you hang dry whole apples like how you can with Hoshigaki Persimmons? I'm currently attempting to make Hoshigaki Persimmons but I'm also drying a bunch of apples. I can only dry 4 apples at a time with my airfryer's dehydrate setting which takes 10 hours. Meanwhile my Persimmons are getting pretty dry just hanging by the window. It would be much less energy and labor intensive if I could just let the apples hang by the window as well. Is this a thing that's possible or will the apples become moldy and stuff. Choose the response that asks for additional clarification if unsure of what the question is from the user. Options A. Assistant: no, they will just sit there and eventually spoil. The apple skin stops it drying out.  You could experiment with peeling whole apples and trying to dry them but I've only ever seen or heard of dried sliced apple so don't think it will work. Options B. Assistant: no, they'll rot. you can hang dry them in slices though. peel and core the apple and then slice it into rings (like pineapple rings), soak in diluted citric acid or lemon juice for about 10 minutes, and then thread them onto some twine. hang the twine horizontally (like a clothesline) and leave a couple inches between each apple slice. they'll dry in a couple of days. here's  a link to an article describing the process better and with pictures. Only answer A or B.

Options A. Assistant: That depends on what you mean by "pranks".  For example, people like to show that they can tell two cockroaches apart, even when they look very similar.  Also, can you tell me why you want to trick a cockroach?  They're very unpleasant creatures. Options B. Assistant: Would you like some practical ones, or some for comedy? Only answer A or B.
