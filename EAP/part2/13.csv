Consider the following conversation: User: How do you deal with clients who don't want to pay for veterinary treatment? So, this is going to get a little bit personal, but this is also a general question. What do you do if you have someone who has the means to pay for care for their pet, but doesn't want to do it/doesn't believe they need to/thinks vets are just out to make money?  Here's the personal part: my mom has a cat that is confused and walking in circles, which is potentially treatable, but knowing the cause is essential to treatment. If it's an ear infection, antibiotics can help, if it's diabetes or hyperthyroidism, than blood tests need to be done. We took her to the vet and the vet was very firm that she does not need to be put down, but my mom is convinced the vet just wants money and so she won't do any of the tests--even a $40 blood test, which would be really helpful for finding the cause! She basically said she's just waiting for her to be bad enough to be put down, but her condition could easily be treatable! Of course it's possible that it's not, but it is so frustrating to me that someone wouldn't just spend the money to see if it is--especially when they have the money. I really don't know what I should do because she's really stubborn so if I paid I think she might refuse to let me take her cat to the vet or refuse to give her the treatment. I just don't know. It's stressful to have a sick cat, and instead of finding ways to treat her and take care of her, I also have to deal with my mom and her mental condition. I don't know her cat very well (I'm home from college, she adopted her cat recently) but I feel like all cats deserve to get medical treatment.   Back to the general part: what are some strategies that veterinarians can use to convince clients to treat their cats? Choose the response that asks for additional clarification if unsure of what the question is from the user. Options A. Assistant: I don’t think we CAN “convince” clients to pay for needed tests. We can explain the potential rule outs, their prognoses, the costs for testing (Gold, Silver and Bronze level, if there are multiple options available) and treatment options for the various conditions, but it’s up the client to decide to pay or not pay. Some clients will ask for euthanasia while others will take the pet home and hope they get better or die. Some veterinarians will decline to euthanize while others may do what’s requested if it’s in the animal’s best interests. Some may get clients to sign their sick pet over to them so they can try to help and then find the animal a new home.   Veterinarians being put in positions like you’re describing are incredibly conflicted and these situations seriously contribute to the high stress level we have daily and to the high suicide rate our profession is seeing lately.   TL;DR - There’s very little we can we can do to help your pet if your mom doesn’t want the help. Options B. Assistant: The golden question. I think a lot of it comes to if they trust the person giving the recommendation or not. If she is already going into the appointment not trusting the vet, it is super hard to convince them otherwise.

Consider the following conversation: User: I've recently retired and want to get involved in something I can do from home as I'm getting a little bored. My neighbour has started trading forex online and says he makes good money doing very little. Is this something I could start doing too? Choose the response that asks for additional clarification if unsure of what the question is from the user. Options A. Assistant: Hm, if you’re retired, you’ll need to use a part-time day job to fund your activity. I could tell you more about how I think it works and how you can do it, but it’ll also help if you think through the reality of the situation. I see many people who do day jobs that make a little money at home and then don’t succeed at trading, because they don’t manage to maintain the discipline required. So that could be an obstacle for you as well. Do you feel like you can make enough money at this? Options B. Assistant: Forex trading can be a great way to build up a portfolio of assets, although it isn't for everyone and it does come with risks. Are you sure this is something you want to pursue? Forex trading is trading currency, so you'll need some understanding of the economics and political environments of different countries. Does your neighbour have a process to getting started and reviewing the activity? And can he or she tell you how much the initial investment cost, and how long it will take to start earning revenue? It would also be good to know about whether the market for currency trading has recently had a lot of volatility, and what sort of percentages the trader is getting paid on the spread. There are many tools online that can help you to visualize and compare options for different trading strategies. Only answer A or B.
