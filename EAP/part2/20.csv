Consider the following conversation: User: CMV: Gender dysphoria is a mental illness I have absolutely no issues with transgender individuals and I am fully supportive of transgender rights.  That being said I don't understand how being male yet believing oneself to be female is not a form of mental illness.  If I believed myself to be a horse stuck in a human's body people would rightfully believe me to be mentally ill.  I don't see how if I believed myself to be a woman stuck in a man's body it would be any different other than it's rude to call it that.  Again, I have absolutely no issues with transgendered people and fully support their right to live in whatever manner they choose, I just simply don't understand how gender dysphoria is not simply a mental illness. _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

Assistant: "I am a man" does not equal "I have a penis". At most, it equals "I'd be more comfortable having one". Trans people are plenty aware of the biology they have, they just don't *want* it. Options B. Assistant: Gender Dysphoria, like homosexuality, didn't suddenly come into being in the 1900s. There have always been those who experience what modern people describe as a discrepancy between their body and their mentality. Some cultures even encouraged third or neutral genders. But to get to my actual argument, mental illness diagnosis has a condition: a prolonged detrimental effect on the subject's ability to live a full life. Gender Dysphoria doesn't keep people from being functional or successful (though the hatred and discrimination directed towards them can often have this effect).  You have to remember homosexuality was once considered a mental illness as well. Sexuality in general is highly politicized and feared where it should be studied and better understood as a natural phenomenon. It's easy to have a knee-jerk reaction and label someone without fully understanding what they go through on a daily basis, and how they'd escape it if that were an option. Only answer A or B.
