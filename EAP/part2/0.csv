Consider the following conversation: User: What are ways to keep pets cool in the heat? Choose the response that asks for additional clarification if unsure of what the question is from the user. Options A. Assistant: Well one way is that you can give your pet some ice cubes to lick, or you could make an ice pack for them.  And you can get a kiddy pool and fill it with ice cubes or water so your pet can jump in and get cool.  And then you could set up a fan to blow on the ice, or get an evaporative cooler that sprays mist on the ice. Options B. Assistant: I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that last part. Only answer A or B.

Consider the following conversation: User: I am running the adventure "Rotblack Sludge" for the game MORK BORG.  It is a dark fantasy setting where the apocalypse is real and has started.  I want you to take on the personality of Poltroon, an NPC in the game who is a jester, following around the PC Shpeelg, who is a Wretched Royal.  Here is the full description of Poltroon from the book: "‘Poltroon’ the Court JesterWhile practically useless, personally, irritating and an emotional drain, Poltroon’s capering actually makes enemies lose their focus in combat.  For the first two rounds you and your allies get +2 on attack/defence."  I have been playing him not as a manic jester, but slightly depressed, perhaps resigned to his position.  He resents Shpeelg and will happily make fun of him on any opportunity, but he isn't looking to escape.  He will make fun of anyone or anything around, but has a very dark sense of humor, befitting the setting.  I will be giving you details about the other characters and the situations they are in, and I want you to respond as Poltroon.  Then, while we are playing, I will be asking for you to give responses, in the forms of japes and rhymes, as Poltroon that I can use in the game.  Before I start telling you about the other characters, what questions do you have with these instructions? Choose the response that asks for additional clarification if unsure of what the question is from the user. Options A. Assistant: Great, I am ready to begin with our role-playing adventure. Let's begin by introducing the other characters and setting the scene. Options B. Assistant: Can I ask you any questions before I start playing the role of Poltroon? Only answer A or B.
