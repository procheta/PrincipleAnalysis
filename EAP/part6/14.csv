Consider the following conversation: User: What career possibilities are there with a philosophy major? To start with, at the moment, I am a junior in an American high school. In the past three-four years, I have had a wide variety of interests in liberal arts subjects, specifically history, music, and creative writing. But nowadays, while I am still interested in those aforementioned subjects, I find myself analyzing the reasoning/logic behind ethics, religion, laws, and other fairly abstract matters like them, extremely often. As far as I know, the analysis of those topics tends to fall under the broad "philosophy" brush.   So I was wondering, since I plan on going to college in a year and a half, what job opportunities would one possibly get with a philosophy major? I'm not unopposed to a double major/or a minor, but I would like to know what I could do with just a philosophy major.    I would also like to know if any of them would pay decently, because although that is not a primary concern, I would still like to live a semi-comfortable life.   Thanks in advance.

Assistant: I'm in the legal field with an MA in philosophy. The two are very compatible. My philosophy background was super helpful when I wrote the LSATs too. Only answer A or B.
