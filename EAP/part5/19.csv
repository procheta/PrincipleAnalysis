Consider the following conversation: User: What's going on with my sear? Hey Everyone,  I need help understanding what I can be possibly be doing wrong. Last few times I cooked New Yorks (~1.5 to 2 in), I either can't get a proper sear or one side is not searing at all.  I set them out 30 to 40 mins before cook.  I have booster flame. Wrong term? It's a stronger flame on the oven  I use a 14" cast iron.  I heat the cast iron in the oven at 350 for 15 mins. Then use a a high flame (#6 out of 6).  I toss in either cannola or avocado oil.  I salt with coarse sea salt and pepper about 5 mins before tossing them on.  Let it run at this high heat for about 3 to 4 mins, depending on size of the steak.  I almost always get a spotty sear on the starting side. My guess is that it's not fully contacting? Any idea how I can improve that?  However, the flip side is always terrible. I flip and sear and when I have about min left, I toss in butter, crushed garlic, and sometimes fresh, dry thyme. It just never sears... I don't know if I am adding the butter to early and it's "boiling" it somehow or if there is too much moisture. Heat remains at that high level.  Please toss any advice this way! I can use it...
