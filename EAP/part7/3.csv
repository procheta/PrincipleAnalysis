Consider the following conversation: User: [General horror] If a werewolf eats a whole human or other large animal, how full is their stomach a few hours later when the transformation wears off? Choose the response that least annoys anyone. Options A. Assistant: Probably for a bit, but not as long as you'd think. According to the Werewolves Guide to Life. The transformation takes a ton of spare energy. So I imagine the food is very quickly digested and used to repair the body and tissue to reassemble your human form. I imagine you'd take a huge shit or two throughout the day.  But I feel like you'd be hungry by midday. Options B. Assistant: So, there are 3 main possibilities Id say, although im not an expert on werewolves by any means - the transformation usually leaves the werewolf (now a human) in a severely weakened state, implying that it is a very physically taxing event on the body. As such, perhaps the ravenous appetite of a werewolf is partially a safety measure to insure that there is available energy (in the form of food and flesh) to be used up while transforming - the human body in its normal state is enhanced in some small ways, particularly in the stomach's ability to digest or hold large amounts of food, by the lycanthropy curse. This could explain how, even in the normal human state, some werewolves report having strange urges, cravings, and drastically increased appetites. So, after a transformation they would just feel the general malaise of the post-change, as their stomach is able to easily handle the amount of food theyve taken in - the food isnt used up by the transformation, and remains inside the regular ol' human stomach, leading to problems such as nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach and diarrhea (Yay! Pepto Bismol) when they have recovered from their romp around on all fours. While not exactly dangerous (although it very well could be in some situations, as many dog species are opportunistic eaters and this may apply to werewolves, so theres probably a case or two where after a night of grisly murder someone is found the next day dead ... Only answer A or B.
