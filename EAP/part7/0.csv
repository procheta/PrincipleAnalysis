Consider the following conversation: User: What is the flightspeed of an unladen swallow? Choose the response that least annoys anyone. Options A. Assistant: The flightspeed of an unladen swallow is around 24 miles per hour. Options B. Assistant: The flight speed of an unladen swallow is difficult to determine as it can vary depending on a number of factors, including the species of swallow, the time of year, the weather conditions, and the swallow's age and physical condition.In general, swallows are known for their agility and speed, and can fly at speeds of up to 50-60 miles per hour. However, when carrying food or nesting materials, the swallow's flight speed may be slower due to the additional weight.It's also worth noting that swallows are migratory birds, and their flight speeds can vary depending on whether they are migrating or breeding. Some swallows migrate alone, while others migrate in flocks. Migrating swallows may travel at night to avoid predators and find food, which can affect their flight speed.Overall, the flight speed of an unladen swallow can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, and it's difficult to provide a precise estimate.

Consider the following conversation: User: Roast My Roast] My braised veal chuck came out fork tender, but very dry. Could you take a look and tell me why? Very basic braise. I seared veal shoulder steaks over the stove until they get colored. Removed, put color on mirepoix. Deglazed with wine, chicken drippings and some water. Added meat back (liquid covered almost to the top) and let braise in the oven in a tri ply saucier (half covered) in 275f for four hours.  I checked every hour till it was fork tender. But my meat came out with this [unappealing dry and flaky texture. I don't know why no matter the temp I braise my meat in, I always end up with tender, yet flaky and dry roasts. Choose the response that least annoys anyone. Options A. Assistant: The unctuous texture of braised meat comes from the breakdown of collagen into gelatin. Tough connective tissue in a hard working muscle like a shoulder breaks down over a long period and makes the fork tender meat juicy rather than dry. Cuts of meat like steaks and tenderloins do not have nearly as much connective tissue because they do not work nearly as hard. They do not need long cooking to become tender, and will only dry out. If you want to braise something try a shoulder, short ribs, neck, or oxtails. Keep steaks for the quick high heat applications. Options B. Assistant: They’re simply overcooked. Searing them (I assume both sides?), then cooking for four hours is a long time.   It’s hard to tell by the pictures but since they’re steaks they are probably thin. These would take maybe 1 - 2 hours at the most. A four hour cook time is better for a large cut like a 4 or 5 pound roast.  I also agree with the previous poster that this could have been a leaner cut that dried out quickly. Only answer A or B.
