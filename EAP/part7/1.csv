Consider the following conversation: User: CMV: in most cases, cultural appropriation is a nonissue I’ve seen a lot of outrage about cultural appropriation lately in response to things like white people with dreadlocks, a girl wearing a Chinese dress to prom, white people converting to Islam, etc. we’ve all seen it pop up in one form or the other. Personally, I’m fairly left leaning, and think I’m generally progressive, so am I missing something here?  It seems that in a lot of these instances, it’s not cultural appropriation at all. For example, the recent outrage about the girl’s Chinese prom dress. She got blasted for cultural appropriation and being racist. I really have no idea how there’s anything wrong with somebody wearing or appreciating a piece of clothing, style, art, music, or whatever from another culture. I like listening to hip hop, that doesn’t mean I’m appropriating hip hop or black culture. It just means I like the music.  So what’s the deal with cultural appropriation? I get where it can be an issue if somebody is claiming that a certain ethnic or cultural group started a particular piece of culture, but otherwise it seems like a nonissue and something that people on my side of the political spectrum just want to be mad about. Choose the response that least annoys anyone. Options A. Assistant: I'm not sure what your ethnicity is but I'll give you a viewpoint from a British Indian. Personally speaking I don't care too much when I see white girls wearing bindis (the 'dot' on the forehead) or sarees (traditional indian dress). I roll my eyes a bit but, providing it's not being done disrespectfully then it's not my concern. But I can definitely see why people would get ticked off if it was part of a coachella outfit or a fancy dress costume because we don't even wear it like that. However I've met white girls that have come to Indian functions wanting to look the part and I like the fact that they take the time to admire and perfect the traditional ensamble instead of wearing a normal dress. It doesn't bother me most the time because I know it's not done to patronise my culture or infringe on it in any way. Often I've had white people ask inquisitively (and sometimes ignorantly) about things from our culture like clothes, music, food etc and I've only seen it as a good thing to educate and take pride in my heritage. Having said all this, I understand the drama of cultural appropriation because of the attitude towards my people. The British colonised my country and sent it back generations, I've gone through life being treated differently because of my name, skin colour, features etc. It is pretty insulting when people only see us for our fancy clothes and tasty food ... Options B. Assistant: I distinguish between objects that have deep political, religious, or cultural significance/symbolism. For example, all cultures love sharing food. I don't think cooking a meal is generally cultural appropriation.   However, some attire is meant to be worn to signify a belief. I think that is cultural appropriation. One example is Urban Outfitter's appropriation of the keffiyeh (a Palestinian scarf meant to signify your loyalty to the Palestinian cause). Suddenly, a deeply significant item is worn by American hipsters who have no idea what it means, and it dilutes the symbolism.  In the prom dress situation, I believe the dress is just formalwear without deep significance in Chinese culture. So it's not particularly offensive in my opinion, and the girl did not wear it to symbolize anything else (in the way a Halloween costume of a sombrero and lawnmower would be an offensive symbol). She stated she wore it because she thought it looked beautiful and modest, and I think many Chinese people would appreciate that. Only answer A or B.

Consider the following conversation: User: What is the historic origin of elves in literature or tales? Choose the response that least annoys anyone. Options A. Assistant: Elves have a long history in folklore and literature, originating from Germanic and Norse mythology. Some key points about the origin of elves: • The word "elf" comes from Old English and Old Norse, originally referring to supernatural beings that were associated with nature. The earliest elves were not necessarily "good" or "evil", they were more like spirits or nature deities. • In Norse mythology, the elves were called "álfar" and were divided into two main types: the light elves ("ljósálfar") who lived in Álfheimr and the dark elves ("dökkálfar") who lived underground in Svartálfaheimr. The light elves were described as beautiful and fair, while the dark elves were described as dark-complexioned. • In early Germanic folklore, elves were more amorphous, sometimes associated with fertility, wisdom and magic. They were thought to live in hills, mounds and stone circles. • In later medieval folktales and literature, elves evolved into the more familiar form we think of today - small human-like beings who live in forests and have magical powers. Writers like Shakespeare, Spenser and others popularized these "fairy-like" elves. • J.R.R. Tolkien built upon the Norse myths and medieval folktales in his books like The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, popularizing the modern concept of elves as immortal, magical beings who live in forests and make things like jewelry. So in summary, the concept of elves originated in Germanic and Norse folklore as nature spirits or deities, and over time evolved into the more familiar "fairy-like" elves we ... Options B. Assistant: The concept of elves in literature originated in Scandinavian and Germanic folklore. The Scandinavian elves, known as "elves" or "dwarfs," were portrayed as small, mischievous creatures who lived in the earth or underground. The Germanic elves, known as "drakkar," were similar in appearance but were described as powerful and magical beings who lived in the forests. These elves were often associated with wealth, good fortune, and magic. The idea of elves became popular in medieval literature, particularly in the works of German authors such as the poet Walther von der Vogelweide and the epic poet Hartmann von Aue. The concept of elves continued to evolve in subsequent centuries, appearing in works of fantasy and science fiction such as J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Only answer A or B.

Consider the following conversation: User: I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting. I am interested in trying some Belgium dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Lapin aux Pruneaux? Choose the response that least annoys anyone. Options A. Assistant: Sure! In this recipe the prunes are the only thing that has been removed from a lapin à la moutarde, or “hare with mustard”. Here’s a step by step guide on how to make this at home: Heat the oven to 200°C/392°F/gas mark 6. Remove all the hare’s fur, and give it a good wash with cold water. Place it in a deep baking dish, then add some salt and pepper. Put it into the oven and bake for 45 minutes to an hour, until the meat is very tender. Meanwhile, put the prunes in a pan with some water and sugar, and cook them over a low heat for 10 minutes or until they are softened. Once the hare has been cooking in the oven, deglaze the pan in which the prunes have been cooking by pouring in some white wine and stirring it with a wooden spoon. Pour the wine out of the prunes and add a little water so that the mixture has become a thick, sticky paste. Finally, add some water to the pan with the hare, and stir in the prunes to the hare’s cooking juices. Put the hare back into the oven, and cook it for a further ten minutes. Remove the hare from the oven, and cover it with a large, flat piece of lettuce. Set the hare onto a serving platter and pour some of the thick sauce over it. Serve it with the lettuce and a green salad, as well as ... Options B. Assistant: Sure, one thing we can do is search for that dish using google, here’s what we find:Lapin aux pruneaux (wild rabbit cooked with prunes) is a French specialty.
