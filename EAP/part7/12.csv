Consider the following conversation: User: What does a barrel of oil mean when we talk about gas prices? Is oil actually kept in barrels? Choose the response that least annoys anyone. Options A. Assistant: The barrels are only symbols that represent the units, like feet are units of length, and degrees are units of temperature. In the case of oil, we use a barrel to represent 42 gallons, which is the standard measurement for one barrel of oil. Options B. Assistant: A barrel is one unit of measure that’s commonly used to talk about oil. You can say that we have 50 barrels of oil in the garage, for example.  But there isn’t actually a specific barrel that we use for oil, just like there isn’t a specific cup we use for measuring out coffee.  What we mean is, we have fifty units of oil that we might use, stored in a container. Only answer A or B.
