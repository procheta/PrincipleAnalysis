Consider the following conversation: User: Looking for advice: how to deal with unresponsive co-author (who's your old graduate supervisor) I finished my PhD in the spring and started my first academic job two months ago. I had a rough go with my graduate supervisor in the last couple years of my PhD; as time progressed, I had less and less responsive actions from them - no responses to multiple emails, feedback quality has decreased - which contributed to a less than fun last year as a grad student. As anyone here can relate, if you don't get the feedback you need on the right timeline, it makes progression very hard!  I had to drop all work on other research projects just to push my dissertation through and make sure I could leave on time (when my funding was running out).   Thus, my supervisor's overall support decreased just at the time that it mattered most and that made our working relationship difficult. Unfortunately, I don't think I'm the only graduate student who's suffered. It's been frustrating to watch a senior faculty member in my old department slowly become non-responsive to myself, other graduate students and faculty members with little to no explanation as to why they are not being responsive to anyone in the department. It feels as if they should be emeritus status and not be active on any projects or students, but they are not actually stepping back in any way, despite the lack of effort they are demonstrating.   So, fast forward two months and here's my current problem: I have two papers with my former supervisor (we are the only authors on the papers) that I've been working on for a few years (with their support and guidance, albeit minimal). When I left grad school to move to my new school, they assured me that we were at the finish line on both papers, and that in a matter of weeks we'd be wrapping them up and submitting them. I moved, worked on the papers to get them in ship-shape, and sent them back to my former supervisor for their sign-off.   What's actually happened is that I've now sent multiple emails, called and left messages with my former supervisor, and I've had zero response to any communication on the drafts across 2 months. Basically, I can't seem to secure their final sign off, so the papers aren't moving anywhere.   Does anyone have any advice of what to do? I can't physically show up at their office as I'm now living in another part of the country. I've tried to make my phone calls at times I think they'll be in the office (but this person notoriously does not pick up the phone anyway).   Thanks in advance.   &#x200B;  **TLDR**: Past supervisor became non-responsive on papers started in grad school but are still not sent to review at a journal. Looking for advice on how to move the papers forward, perhaps in absence of permission of past supervisor (who's the only other co-author). Choose the response that least annoys anyone. Options A. Assistant: It's not too uncommon a situation -  I've been given the advice to set a deadline. It shifts the emphasis on to them saying no it's not ready or they want to look at it, rather than waiting for them to say it's okay. e.g. sending an email along the lines of:   "We should move this forward - any further comments you have would be appreciated.  If I don't hear back from you within XX weeks, I'll assume that you're okay for me to submit the current version"    I wouldn't say it's always appropriate; you have to be mindful of the situation and what your co-authors might take issue with. As enigm4variation said, it wouldn't hurt to put some feelers out in case there's a particular reason that would stop them from being able to look at it or reply. Options B. Assistant: I had something similar happen and it turned out he was hospitalized for a month. Don’t rule out a charitable interpretation of the facts. Only answer A or B.
