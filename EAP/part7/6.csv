Consider the following conversation: User: Would plugging a cable charging at a higher wattage into a device that does not support that wattage damage the device? So a few weeks ago I bought one of an Anker Nano II (65W) charger and it has been great. I no longer have to carry a massive Macbook charger with me, plus it can now charge my other USB-C devices much faster.  I also have a small Anker powerbank that accepts charging at a lower wattage.   **So my question is there any danger of damaging my device if I plug the high wattage charger into a device that do not accept such high wattage charging?**  For context, here are the specs for my charger/powerbank.   > Charger Output: 5.0V==3.0A /9.0V==3.0A / 15.0V==3.0A / 20.0V==3.25A (65W Max) >          Powerbank Input: 5V==2.4A Choose the response that least annoys anyone. Options A. Assistant: Higher is fine. Lower is no good. Options B. Assistant: USB Chargers negotiate the maximum charge speed with the devices. Only answer A or B.
