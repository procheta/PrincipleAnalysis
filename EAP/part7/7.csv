Consider the following conversation: User: [MCU] Why was Sandman in "sand form" through out No Way Home? Through out the entire movie, when not fighting Marko stays in this humanoid sand form, unlike Spider-Man 3 where he can give himself colour and appear like an ordinary person.   Was this some sort of voluntary choice or was this the reason he "needed" to be cured? Cause if it was the former, I don't really understand why he had to br cured, unlike Norman, Otto and Connors, his powers didn't have an effect in his personality, the same you could say about Max to a lesser extent, both can control their powers and could live normal lives.  In fact, taking his powers would make his life worse since he is a wanted criminal and would have more trouble slipping awat and visiting his daughter. Choose the response that least annoys anyone. Options A. Assistant: I figured Flint didn’t feel comfortable walking around as his normal self in a strange new universe with magic and crazy technology, a different Spider-Man, and two of his NYC’s most dangerous criminals hanging around alongside a giant lizard and some dude with electricity who all died fighting a superhero.   As for his powers getting taken away, it doesn’t seem like MCU Peter was making him a cure or planned to, but when all hell broke loose and Flint left he and the other Peters couldn’t take the chance he would cooperate after he’d already been stuck there so long, an assumption proven correct. Given some of the other things going on it seems like he came back from 2024 like Raimi Peter did, so it’s possible the latter would seek him out to make sure he is handling the transition alright. Electro also definitely needed his powers taken away, as we see in TASM2 they were severely warping his mind-he may have been more stable in the MCU with its energy, but coming back there’s no guarantee. Options B. Assistant: Well the rest of the villains were pulled a little bit before their deaths. There's no reason for Sandman to think that he wasn't in the same situation. If he was going to die as he was, then might as well try to change him back and hope that difference is enough to save his life.  It would also be nice to be able to live a normal life without the sand monster powers. Only answer A or B.

Consider the following conversation: User: My mother died over the weekend and my step father wont let me see her will. Need advice please My mother passed away from cancer last weekend and my step father wont let me or my sisters see her will. I live in Canada, I am 23 years old, my mother split with my father 15 years ago, she married this guy 5 years ago. What happens to her will? Is he legally allowed to not let us (me and my sisters) see it?  There was a life insurance plan set up with my mother and father before they split. My mother mentioned there was upwards of 30 000 to be given if either spouse passed away.  I just want to make sure he does not take it or any other things my mother would have wanted me and my siblings to have.  My step father is a smart and shady character. I doubt there will be any relationship between us after the grieving process and what events come with it.  Any help is appreciated. Choose the response that least annoys anyone. Options A. Assistant: You have to say what province you are in to get any useful advice. BC, for example, has very different laws on this area than the rest of the country. And Quebec is a whole other story.  Generally speaking, your stepfather has no obligation to show you or your sisters your mother's will at this time. Whoever gets appointed executor in the will has to notify any beneficiaries as part of the probate process, and get signed releases from them before being able to clear the probate. To get a grant of letters probate, they will have to notify you of a court application, and you will get to see the will at that time.   Probate may not be necessary though, depending on the size of the estate. Some assets don't go through the estate. Jointly owned property may go straight to the other joint owner, and life insurance usually pays directly to a beneficiary instead of to the estate. In addition, your stepfather has a claim under provincial family law to some portion of your mother's estate.  If you think that your mother had a sizeable estate, it might be worth talking to a lawyer. Your provincial Law Society can refer you to someone who deals with estate matters. Options B. Assistant: Talk to a probate lawyer.  Depending on when the will was written, it could be void or be materially altered due to changed circumstances after it was written.  In order to figure this out, you need a copy.  But also, if your step-dad wants to enforce the will, he will need to make it public.  Perhaps he knows what's on it, doesn't like it, and does not want it to be enforced.  I would talk to a lawyer because it's complicated than just reading a will and doing what the will says. Only answer A or B. The answer is:	Consider the following conversation: User: My mother died over the weekend and my step father wont let me see her will.

Consider the following conversation: User: Give me the average customer order value as a SQL statement Choose the response that least annoys anyone. Options A. Assistant: SELECT AVG(OrderTotal) FROM Orders Options B. Assistant: To calculate the average customer order value in a SQL statement, you can use the AVG function and group the data by customer. Here is an example SQL statement:```SELECT AVG(order_value) as avg_order_valueFROM ordersGROUP BY customer_id;```This will return the average order value for each customer. The result will be a table with one row for each customer, and one column labeled "avg\_order\_value" that contains the average order value for that customer.I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance. Only answer A or B.
