Consider the following conversation: User: CMV: The unequal distribution of total wealth in the U.S. is taking away the American Dream and a stronger progressive tax policy would fix this. With the unequal distribution of wealth in the United States:  The top 20% account for 85% of the United States total wealth   The top 1% account for 34.6% of the United States total wealth  (https://whorulesamerica.ucsc.edu/power/wealth.html) and the unequal distribution of income:  The top 1% income increased by 275% since 1979 while the bottom 60% only increased by 40%.  The tax rate on the top 400 earners has decreased by 37%.  It is becoming exceedingly difficult for those not in the top 20% to really have the opportunity for economic mobility. I know that the American Dream is defined more than just economic mobility but I feel it is also a big part of why people come to America. Generally immigrants come for the opportunity to improve their livelihood, something closely linked to ones economic mobility.  I believe a more aggressive progressive tax policy would fix this as additional income could be used further support social policies that would help those 40.6 million living in poverty and the rest of the bottom 80%. With the additional support provided, the economic mobility of the bottom 80% would be restored.  _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

Assistant: There are a few questions worth asking before approaching this view more closely: 1) Is the problem more due to wealth disparity or income disparity? 2) Do you want to tax income or total wealth? 3) Ideally, we want to maximize the average wealth in a society while minimizing wealth disparity. In practice, there is often a trade-off. Which is more important: maximizing average wealth or minimizing wealth disparity? 4) If income inequality necessarily increases as average wealth increases, is that okay, or is that a problem? To go in to (3) a bit more, a sufficiently progressive income tax would fix income inequality, but might have unintended negative consequences. Suppose that *Country Z* has four people. Three make $20,000 annually and are taxed at 10% of their income. One person, Emily, makes $1,000,000 annually and is taxed at 10% of her income for the first $500,000 and 40% beyond that. The total taxes collected is $256,000. Suppose *Country Z* decides to use income taxes to reduce income inequality. All income beyond $500,000 is taxed at 100%. Tax rates below $500,000 remain unchanged. Now the taxes collected should be $556,000. There's a problem, though. Emily decides to move to *Country Y* that has a more favorable income tax schedule. So, instead *Country Z* collects just $6,000 in taxes. But it gets worse. Because Emily made up such a huge portion of the economy, the average income of the remaining three citizens drops 10%. Now *Country Z* is only bringing in ... Options B. Assistant: Equality of outcome is not the American Dream.  It is the Soviet dream... The Communist dream.  The American Dream is Equality of Opportunity... And it's alive and well. Only answer A or B.

Consider the following conversation: User: Do these Asian pears look okay? This is my first time ever buying and using them. I should've done more research and asked more questions before buying! These right here. Choose the response that least annoys anyone. Options A. Assistant: Yep! Those look fine. I personally prefer peeling these pears before eating them, I'm not a huge fan of the taste of pear skin. Options B. Assistant: Perfectly normal for them to have spots on the outside, just like pears you might be used to.  The flesh on the inside is white and crunchy. If you see significant brown on the inside, or it's mushy or slimy, then you have a problem. But the outside looks totally normal in your pic.  Asian pears are very fragile and can bruise easily, so if you do see any bruises in the white flesh inside, you can just discard that bruised bit, just like you would for other fruit. Only answer A or B. The answer is:	Consider the following conversation: User: Do these Asian pears look okay? This is my first time ever buying and using them.
