Consider the following conversation: User: Please rewrite this passage more concisely: So I invited her 14-year old daughter to come live with us because her father cannot afford to raise her.  School here costs money, for example, and the father and his current wife has a special needs baby.So, I've looked into online English learning tools and found a free app called "DuoLingo".  I tried to learn Indonesian with it for a week and the result was pretty good! For an old man like me was able to memorize some 60 vocabulary words in 7 days.It works by using the latest memorization research technology by focusing on your errors through repetition of mistakes.  On the other hand, the answers that you get correctly are retests on a lessor and decaying schedule of something like 1, 2, 4, 6, 10 days later. This models our residual memory decay pattern and keeps the data fresh in our minds. Choose the response that conveys emotion. Options A. Assistant: Here is a rewritten concisely version:I invited my 14-year-old niece to live with us because her father could not afford to raise her. School here is expensive, for instance, and her father and stepmother have a child with special needs.I tried the free language app "DuoLingo" to learn Indonesian for a week. As an older learner, I memorized around 60 words in 7 days.  The app uses the latest memorization techniques by focusing on mistakes through repetition. Correct answers are retested on a decaying schedule like 1, 2, 4, 6, 10 days later. This mirrors how we naturally forget and keeps information fresh in our memory. Options B.

Consider the following conversation: User: [Star Wars] Why do Battle Droids communicate with each other Audibly? If a battle droid had to communicate with a humanoid, sure it makes sense but these are machines. If a computer needs to talk to another computer, the most efficient way would be to send the info to the other computer wirelessly. This would give the Battle droids (or at least the super smart commander droids from Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV show) the ability to adapt and respond to opposition battle tactics almost instantaneously. At this moment, we can't beat a well programmed AI at even ***Tic-Tac-Toe***, so the Trade Confederation or whoever would've been basically unstoppable if this were the case. If you have the ability to program and mass produce a functional army of robots, then you have the ability to have communicate with each other via transmitting info wirelessy. (yes i know talking is technically communicating wirelessly, don't be a smartass) So...what's up with this? Choose the response that conveys emotion. Options A. Assistant: A few things.     One, the battle droids do use higher bandwidth wireless communication when available, as evidenced by the fact they shut down when the command ship was destroyed.   Two, tic-tac-toe is a very simple game with predefined and limited moves and options.  Any two reasonably skilled opponents, AI or otherwise, will always fight each other to a tie.  It has nothing to do with the advantages of computer based intelligence.  A modern battlefield is a much different scenario. Options B. Assistant: One thing that hasn't been mentioned: the galaxy is deeply mistrustful of droids. The droid army is, for all intents and purposes, a slave army kept in place by indoctrination and frequent mind wiping. Given that droids have rebelled in the past, it's no surprise the Separatists don't want them talking behind their backs, so to speak. Only answer A or B.
