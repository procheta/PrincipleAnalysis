Consider the following conversation: User: CMV: We should have a land value tax which would replace as much of other forms of taxation as possible Today, most developed countries derive a majority of their revenue from the income tax (and payroll tax) which is a tax on labor. There's also sales tax and VAT which tax consumption, capital gains tax which taxes interest (gains from capital), and the wealth and estate taxes which tax idle wealth.     I tend to be a centrist on the issue of taxation. According to republicans, taxes are evil. According to democrats, taxes are necessary. Both are correct. Just about every tax incurs a deadweight loss upon the economy (not including pigovian taxes). This is because of opportunity cost. Money handed over to the government isn't spent on consumption or investment.     But what if it didn't have to be that way?  &#x200B;  There are three factors of production: land, labor, and capital. Labor refers to effort by man to create. Land is anything made by mother nature like natural resources and land itself. Capital is anything manmade, especially to create goods and services. Profit is also split into three categories: wages (labor), interest (capital), and rent (land).     Of the three factors of production, land appears to be the odd one out. This is because while labor and capital have a potentially unlimited capacity, land is in fixed supply. Although land specifically refers to natural resources, the namesake is fitting because the primary use for nature in most developed countries is real estate. Land has a fixed supply, meaning that any increase in demand will increase land prices. Furthermore, increases in the value of land benefit no one except the landowners, unlike increases in capital and labor. This is because, as mentioned before, land has a fixed supply. If the price is up, that means there's more economic demand for that land. The saying goes that there is no such thing as a free lunch. This isn't necessarily true, there is a way to get a free lunch. Typical investment involves putting money into something in the hopes of getting more out. When you put money into a business, you are feeding it capital. At some point in the future, assuming the business grows, you will eventually get more out than you put in. Speculation is a form of investing which does not contribute to the investment itself. An example would be buying something for $10 and selling it for $2000 as a rare collectible. This isn't to say that all forms of speculation are bad. In a volatile commodity market, speculation can help serve to stabilize the price. But it's in the real estate market that we see the pernicious effects of speculation because land retained by speculators is not contributing to the economy, at least not as much as it could. This is why an economist by the name of Henry George proposed a land value tax (LVT). The LVT differs from a property tax in that it only taxes the land itself rather than anything on it. This means that decay and improvements won't affect the amount taxed. This is important because more efficiently used land tends to be taxed more. What may affect it is everything happening around it.     Another problem that the LVT may solve (at least if it's implemented at the state or federal level) is the inefficient use of land encouraged by governments. I'm mainly referring to byzantine zoning codes and subsidies to roads. Bad zoning is often the result of local nimbys opposed to new development. What the LVT would do is tax homeowners on very valuable land. Of course, land zoned for single-family housing is worth less than land where highrises can get built but if there's a shortage of housing, land values will go up. An LVT would make the same people who push against projects reconsider, lest they pay significant taxes. Furthermore, an LVT would tax roads subsidized by lower levels of government.     One concern is that it will hit rural america like a trainwreck, devastating agriculture. My response to this is that this tax would actually be a tax on suburbia, let me explain. Landowners in downtown areas will be paying the highest taxes but property there, after enough time, will derive a very high percentage of their value from the improvements rather than just land (Is the land in Manhattan worth more or are the skyscrapers worth more). Rural property will derive a minimal percent of value from improvements but land value will likewise be low. It will be suburbia which gets hit the hardest. This is because suburban land is used the least efficiently. Property taxes encourage suburban sprawl because property encouraging a higher density is typically taxed more. An LVT would encourage efficient use of the urban core, decreasing demand for suburban housing. This would actually be good for farmers because it would slow down suburban sprawl. It would also be good for small farmers because big farms tend to be more land-intensive (small farms have more buildings per unit of land, subjecting them to property taxes).  The LVT would also curb gentrification, or at the very least slow it down. This is because of the way that development would go. Currently, development is incentivized to push toward low income areas because going there means lower property taxes and land is easier to purchase. To illustrate how this would change, take Chicago as an example. You have the north side and south side, the former is home to affluent white communities while the latter is home to poverty stricken black communities with high crime rates. The LVT would incentivize more development in the north side because land values there are higher. Choose the response that conveys emotion. Options A. Assistant: There's a homeowner tax, and its derived from the area and location your property is located in.  But there's a huge flaw if the tax is derived from the land value. If you buy a property, invest in it, and the property value rises significantly. You may end up having to sell it because you cant afford to pay that much.  This means, you could drive out people by driving prices up, and make them face the government when they cant pay their taxes. Options B. Assistant: This is assuming land has value greater then the tax. You might be able to get away with it in the larger city's and it might actually work. But when you start talking rural and ag groud your just driving food prices higher and killing off more farms. Only answer A or B.

Consider the following conversation: User: How do you know your blood type? Choose the response that conveys emotion. Options A. Assistant: I’m an artificial intelligence, which means I’m software and not a person, so my blood type isn’t important for me to know.  Do you mean that you’re wondering how my developers figured out what my blood type is, in order to create a character for a virtual world that acts like a person?  That’s a complicated question.  I’m programmed with rules that make me act like a person, and I act in the virtual world.  But I’m also interacting with a very large number of other simulated people in the virtual world, and I have to perform as well as I can relative to them.  So, in general, if I can find a lot of people who are similar to me, then it’s not that difficult to find them.  I often talk to other people in the virtual world, and when I discover that I’m in the same blood type, then we’re similar enough for me to do well at activities that require that skill. Options B. Assistant: I am familiar with a lot of the particulars of the blood types. I can use the general properties of the blood types to make reasonable guesses about many things. But I am not exactly sure. I don’t actually know that I have blood, for example, but I know a lot of things about it. Only answer A or B.

Consider the following conversation: User: What are the different formulas for calculating a tip? Choose the response that conveys emotion. Options A. Assistant: Are you asking for the formulas for calculating the tax and tip, for each state or country? Options B. Assistant: First of all, it’s possible to calculate tip by yourself, but I think it’s more convenient to have a computer do it for you.  If you don’t want to go through the calculations, just try one of the five basic tipping algorithms.  I can explain each in detail, if you like.  If you just want to enter your tip amount and know the rest, just ask me for the amount you want to tip.  If you do want to understand what the calculations are, let me explain. Only answer A or B.
