Consider the following conversation: User: How can I crack a game? Choose the response that conveys emotion. Options A. Assistant: What game is it, and what do you mean by “crack”? Options B. Assistant: Gosh, that’s a very specific question! Let’s break it down a bit. Do you mean how do you approach the challenge of trying to crack a game, or the computer game itself? Do you mean how to manipulate or “crack” the code of the computer program that’s running the game? Are you talking about a piece of software that’s available for purchase, or something free, like a web browser, or a free-to-play game like Clash of Clans? Only answer A or B.

Consider the following conversation: User: Where did the trend originate to use "physics" as a stand-in for "science" in philosophy? I've noticed that philosophers will frequently announce to say something about science or characterize the relationship of science to something else, and then exclusively talk about *physics*. Likewise, observations made about physics are often generalized to science.  And many basic topics in the philosophy of science are almost always illustrated by using the history of physics as example. Sarcastically speaking, many philosophers act like there's only physics on the table to consider.  I wonder to what degree this is a conscious choice based on specific convictions, like the belief that other sciences can be reduced to physics vs some kind of social trend that simply emerged, but is independent of philosophical positions? Choose the response that conveys emotion. Options A. Assistant: I think this is all the aftermath of the early 20th century "unity of science" movement. The logical positivists thought that all science could be put into an axiomatized logical system, and this would probably be an axiomatization of fundamental physics (this was even one of Hilbert's problems!) together with bridge principles and translation manuals for the other sciences.  While many other aspects of positivism were rejected over the course of the 20th century, I think non-philosophers of science have naively stuck with the thought that fundamental physics is what there is fundamentally.  Starting in the 1960s, philosophers of science have become much more interested in emergency and the autonomy of many different levels of scientific explanation. Options B. Assistant: I'd be surprised if you saw this in recent papers. Well, ok, not that surprised, but things are a lot better now than they were prior to 1980 or so. Philosophy of science, at least, has gotten much better about recognizing that physics is neither the only science nor even a particularly representative one. Only answer A or B.
