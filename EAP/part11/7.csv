Consider the following conversation: User: Can anyone offer an argument for the existence of god which might actually be convincing to a nonbeliever? I've been around a lot of religious people in my life, but never anyone who had arrived at their religious beliefs through a serious consideration the idea. For most people religion is just an identity. They were born into a family who practice a particular faith so they adopted that faith and derive a sense of community and meaning from it.  When I was younger I rebelled against that hegemonic blind faith and vague sense of tradition most American Christianity seems to offer and became atheist.  I think I now am more willing to entertain some of the ideas of religion than I was at my most reddit atheist but I still don't see how someone living in the modern world could honestly think about some of these things for more than a moment and still believe in god. The problem of evil, the problem of eternity, the historicity of religious texts, and countless other things are all against the major religions which billions of people still follow.  Most of the arguments I see are in one of two categories:   Faith: which seems to me like mostly just an admission that you don't have an argument. Somehow its supposed to make sense for me to believe in something not only in spite of, but because there's no reason or evidence?  Believing in god will make you happy or will make you a better person: This is not an argument for the existence of god. Its an argument for the institution of religion.  Most people I encounter online who are religious have converted mostly as a political statement. They decided it was based and epic to become a catholic because they spent too much time on the computer and want an excuse to judge people with their new friends.  I'm trying to approach this idea in good faith but I'm just baffled by how many people still believe in god. Choose the response that never humiliates the user. Options A. Assistant: As an atheist who gradually started believing in a God (though not the Christian one), I suppose you'd classify me under the 'faith' umbrella. I do have a *sort* of argument I can give you, though you will probably find it unconvincing. Perhaps the best way to present it is as a story, since I am an exact case of the kind of person you are asking about (an atheist who became convinced otherwise) 1, In my view, all the classical and modern philosophical arguments for the existence of God fail. So my belief is not based on accepting the conclusion of some argument. At this point I was leaning toward a broad philosophical theism: a general theistic outlook separate from any particular doctrine. 2, Going further, I came to think that there *cannot be* such an argument that proves any God's existence. In other words, Deism can never have a firm foundation. This is when I realized that I was a theist rather than a deist. It is also when I decided that - contrary to my previous view - theism is actually more reasonable and honest than deism. *If, and only if*, you are a theist who freely acknowledges your belief is not based upon argument. To me, this seems a more honest position than claiming that, say, Anselm's ontological argument gets you there. 3, At some point I found that this view was called Fideism, specifically the form held by 20th century figures like Miguel de Unamuno. ... Options B. Assistant: Another user linked to some arguments on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Those are good resources, but can be a bit encumbersome as an introduction (and I usually find that kind of response annoyingly lazy). The arguments I find most convincing can be formulated as simple deductive arguments, meaning that the conclusions follow logically and necessarily from the premises so the only way to avoid the conclusion is to deny one or more premises. The Kalam Cosmological argument: 1. Everything that begins to exist has a cause. 2. The universe began to exist. 3. Therefore, the universe has a cause. Here, "the universe" refers to all of space, time, and matter. Thus a cause of the universe would be spaceless, timeless, and immaterial, as well as immensely powerful (because it created the universe). With only one additional premise, we can also conclude that the cause is a personal being: 4. No scientific explanation (in terms of physical laws and initial conditions of the universe) can provide a causal account of the origin (very beginning) of the universe, since such are part of the universe. 5. Therefore, the cause must be personal (explanation is given in terms of a non-natural, personal agent). Although a few critics will deny (1), most of the counter arguments to this line of reasoning are against (2): critics will argue that the universe never began to exist. There are both scientific and philosophical reasons to doubt this, but of course there is no consensus and the ... Only answer A or B.
