Consider the following conversation: User: What would happen if a significant number of customers closed their bank accounts in a short amount of time? This is an economics question about the current call to close your bank accounts. I'm sorry if this is too political of a question, but I was curious as to what would happen if a significant number of people pulled their money out from the big banks and opened accounts with credit unions. Specifically, what would be the potential economic impact if a) the banks lose all that money and, b) local credit unions receive all this money.  Please keep your opinions on the OWS movement out of this. Though OWS inspired this question, that's not what this is about. Choose the response that never humiliates the user. Options A. Assistant: The bank would have a Liquidity Crisis. It's probably one of the surest ways to crowd source a hurt on a bank. Options B. Assistant: So as has been pointed out, there will be a Liquidity Crisis as well as a Bank Run, but there will also be larger fall out from a run on the banks as well. If the bank that has the run on it is one of the larger banks, BoA, Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Capitol One, etc. there would be larger issues at stake than peoples college funds. These banks aren't your local credit union and have global reach. Thanks to deregulation these banks not only are where you but your lemonade stand money, but large corporations get their loans as well as investors get collateral for major Wall Street transactions. They also hold massive amounts of bonds, stocks, and other financial abstracts. If people made a run on these banks, they would be forced to sell off these assets in order to acquire the hard cash the customers would need in order to move their funds. Now because they would be dumping hundreds of millions or even up to a billion dollars onto the market in the span of a few hours or days, the markets would spiral. It can go either way at this point on Wall Street. Either the investors can snap up those assets coming onto the market driving the prices up, which means the index goes up, so the bank ends up cushioning the impact, though there will be an impact... If the opposite happens and a panic occurs, we have a problem. The bank ... Only answer A or B.
