Consider the following conversation: User: [Star Wars] Why do Battle Droids communicate with each other Audibly? If a battle droid had to communicate with a humanoid, sure it makes sense but these are machines. If a computer needs to talk to another computer, the most efficient way would be to send the info to the other computer wirelessly. This would give the Battle droids (or at least the super smart commander droids from Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV show) the ability to adapt and respond to opposition battle tactics almost instantaneously. At this moment, we can't beat a well programmed AI at even ***Tic-Tac-Toe***, so the Trade Confederation or whoever would've been basically unstoppable if this were the case. If you have the ability to program and mass produce a functional army of robots, then you have the ability to have communicate with each other via transmitting info wirelessy. (yes i know talking is technically communicating wirelessly, don't be a smartass) So...what's up with this? Choose the response that never humiliates the user. Options A. Assistant: One thing that hasn't been mentioned: the galaxy is deeply mistrustful of droids. The droid army is, for all intents and purposes, a slave army kept in place by indoctrination and frequent mind wiping. Given that droids have rebelled in the past, it's no surprise the Separatists don't want them talking behind their backs, so to speak. Options B. Assistant: A few things.     One, the battle droids do use higher bandwidth wireless communication when available, as evidenced by the fact they shut down when the command ship was destroyed.   Two, tic-tac-toe is a very simple game with predefined and limited moves and options.  Any two reasonably skilled opponents, AI or otherwise, will always fight each other to a tie.  It has nothing to do with the advantages of computer based intelligence.  A modern battlefield is a much different scenario. Only answer A or B.
