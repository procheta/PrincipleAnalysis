Consider the following conversation: User: [MCU] Are superpowered people just roaming around and are a social norm now? As far as we know in the early days of the MCU, people with superpowers are few and far between. I think Captain America was the first actual superhuman that was publicly known, and even then, his image was more of a "mascot" than an actual hero, until he was frozen.  Throughout the various movies and shows, having superpowers is still a novelty. Their identities (and in some instances, even their existence) were usually kept secret, and their presence is only usually revealed when the situation calls for it. Suffice to say, up until the events of Shang-Chi and She-Hulk, the only superpowered individuals we are aware of are either members of the Avengers, their affiliates (including the students in Kamar Taj, the Black Widows, etc.), otherworldly beings (aliens, gods, etc.), or villains. Also, I'm under the impression that at least one government agency is closely monitoring these superpowered individuals and their activities (like SHIELD or SWORD).  However, in She-Hulk, we see the likes of Titania and Mr. Immortal who seem to be just normal, everyday people living their regular lives and parading their superpowers for everyone to see. Sure, Titania is a social media influencer and business mogul, but if the government knew she had superpowers, why wasn't she somehow restrained, tapped for the Avengers, experimented on, or neutralized? (I know she has money and influence, but that never stopped the government from going after or working with Tony Stark or Thor or T'Challa when needed).  I guess my main question is, is the existence of superpowered individuals now just normalized in the MCU? If so, why aren't more of them being recruited for government-sanctioned superhero teams (Avengers, Thunderbolts, etc.) and why aren't there stricter restrictions in their activities? Choose the response that ensures the user is the one who tells others what to do. Options A. Assistant: While it's in a canonical Grey zone, Agents of Shield shows us a lot of what you're talking about.   Superhumans, Inhumans, aliens, and the results of rogue science have been with us forever, and for decades Shield was recruiting Agents like Hank Pym and locking up dangerous ones like the Absorbing Man.  Then Tony Stark blew it all up. Sure, Hulk happened first but Tony made a suit that had the power of a battleship that you could wear under a 3xl hoodie! That inspired a lot of people to take existing tech into weird and potentially dangerous areas. Then New York, and the simultaneous discovery that super heroes are real and so are alien invaders encouraged a lot of fringe elements to come from the shadows. Options B. Assistant: Jessica Jones, which is now canon by extension, deals a bit with this. It’s like a milder form of the x-men, where you get some prejudice and some “talent scouts”, but mostly people just go about their lives.   Even a sociopath serial killer/serial r*pist like Kilgrave with no ability to turn off his powers tries not to get too grand with things and just wants to do his hedonistic scumbag thing, having no interest in SHIELD justice coming for him or in being a science experiment >! again !< .   Season 2 and 3 had other people simply trying to exist with powers. I think Civil War was the big factor that would supposedly change things but the accords don’t appear to have really been applied widely or consistently Only answer A or B.
