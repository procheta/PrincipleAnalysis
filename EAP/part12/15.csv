Consider the following conversation: User: CMV: Political Correctness was never much of an issue, and today the word "Political Correctness" is mostly used wrongly to disguise racism, sexism, homophobia, or to attack progressive social views with no real arguments. In short, my point is this :  1) There are multiple possible definitions of P.C.  2) One of these definitions refers to a behavior which is a bit ridicule, therefore easy to mock. (I will call it "silly PC")  3) A lot of people have spent a lot of time attacking, criticizing and mocking this form of PC, therefore giving the word "PC" a bad image.  4) The word is also used to refer to some progressive social ideas (We will call this "progressive PC")  5) The bad image of Silly PC is used as an argument against progressive PC, despite the fact that they are not the same thing.  Now, some details and explanations.   2) Political Correctness originally refers to the idea of changing your language and actions in order to be very careful not to offend anyone. This behavior (which we will call "silly PC") can be observed on some places of the Internet (like tumblr), and in some public figures (politicians, companies, etc..) who don't want bad press. Another facet of this behavior is people who get offended at almost anything, and attack anything that offends them as racist/sexist/homophobic. These are the infamous Social Justice Warriors. This behavior is a bit laughable, but it's not a big deal. Sometimes there's a good reason for silly PC (companies can really suffer from a community getting offended), but even when it's unjustified it doesn't do much harm. Contrarily to what is said, PC has never been oppressing or restricting of liberties. There isn't, that I know of, any law or regulation which prohibits offending people. The worst that can happen to someone for not respecting silly PC is getting yelled at by some twats on the Internet. However :  3) Despite not being such a big deal, silly PC has been massively attacked by the Internet. There are countless videos and memes mocking silly PC, highlighting every way in which it's stupid, and calling it an attack on freedom. Basically, silly PC has a very bad press. It's seen as a form of oppression from the system, and political incorrectness is seen as edgy rebellion (despite being very mainstream).  4) Everything I've said until now wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't for this next point : PC has another meaning. It refers to a wide, vaguely defined range of social progressive ideas, which mostly fall along the lines of defending gender equality, racial equality, and acceptance of the LGBT community. This second definition will be called "progressive PC". I want to emphasize that silly PC and progressive PC are two different things. It's possible to defend gender equality with some very controversial statements that will offend a lot of people. It's also possible to follow silly PC while defending some conservative anti-gay policies. When a Christian right politician says that he defends "freedom of religion" when he's in fact trying to defend Christianity and oppress atheism, that person is thinking one thing but saying another in fear of upsetting someone. Silly PC is not the same as progressive PC. It so happens that, at the time the word "Political Correctness" became popular, a lot of examples of silly PC were from people who defended progressive social ideas, so the association was made.  5) Unfortunately, most people don't seem to realize that silly PC and progressive PC are two different things. They use the words "PC" to mean alternatively one or the other, without any distinction. This is bad, because it results in one of the worst equivocation fallacies of modern times. Progressive PC is called "PC", and PC has a very bad image because of silly PC. People will justify why they don't like PC with silly PC, then use the fact that they don't like PC to attack progressive PC. In the process, no valid argument has been made against progressive PC, yet it's lost a lot of credibility. I have seen many instances of people using PC to justify racism, sexism or homophobia. What I see most however is people reacting to changes and policies which don't do any harm and slightly improve the world by calling it "PC" and disproving with no further justification.  In the end, the very existence of the term "Political Correctness" is a nuisance to mankind. It reacts to an issue which never was a real issue, and it's used as a shield and banner for sexism, racism and homophobia. _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

Assistant: Political correctness is America's newest form of intolerance, and it is especially pernicious because it comes disguised as tolerance. It presents itself as fairness, yet attempts to restrict and control people's language with strict codes and rigid rules. I'm not sure that's the way to fight discrimination. I'm not sure silencing people or forcing them to alter their speech is the best method for solving problems that go much deeper than speech. - George Carlin He also once said that political correctness is fascism pretending to be manners. Political correctness is the British National Health Service instructing doctors and nurses not to call pregnant persons mothers. The guidelines stated, “This guide promotes good practice through the use of language that shows respect for and sensitivity towards everyone. The choice of appropriate words makes an important contribution towards the celebration of diversity." Avoiding the word mother is not how you show respect if avoiding that word is not a personal choice but a rule to follow. The idea that restricting language to avoid offense does not suddenly make the feelings behind the offending behavior go away. You cannot expect racism sexism or transphobia to cease to exist by excluding certain words from our vocabulary. In fact, not allowing a person to express themselves with the words they want to use will make it harder to end racism, sexism, and the phobias. Just because a white person doesn't use the n-word doesn't mean they aren't racist. Or just because a person misgenders ... Options B. Assistant: I think the issue people have is the "defending" part. Where every social situation needs to take into account your political views or be called out.   For instance, it sucks when comedians get hate for edgy jokes. Because that environment is not a political environment. I think you might think something like "there is so space where equality shouldn't be respected and bigots should feel free to speak hate". And I think it comes down to a real inability of many people to spot the difference between bigotry and having fun with stereotypes, or often the joke itself being at the expense of bigots but they don't get the joke.
